Some of my personal interests include spicy food (especially curries), weightlifting, horror, scifi, and reading. I have two dogs. An eight year old flat coat retriever mix named [Rafael](/assets/rafa.jpg), Rafa for short, and a 2 year old Golden Retriever named [Luna](/assets/looney.jpg), affectionately called Looney.

I've competed in a couple local competitons in weightlifting since about 2014. I've recently stopped competing and shifted my training to be more focused on health and strength.
