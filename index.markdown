## Introduction

I am a Senior Member of Technical Staff at Oracle Cloud Infrastructure working with the Compute
Control Plane Platform Services and Supporting Services team. Which includes designing, creating
and maintaining features such as Instance tags, quotas, and console connections.

I graduated Summa Cum Laude from the University of Kentucky in December 2012.

My interests include: Embedded Systems, Distributed Systems, Graphics, and Information Security. I
am keen on using C, Rust, Python, and Haskell.
